# Contributing to Cloud Seeder

Welcome to the Cloud Seeder project! We are excited to have you as a part of our movement to bring self hosting to everyone. This document outlines the process for contributing to Cloud Seeder, and how you can get involved in a way that is helpful to the project.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all forms. There are many ways to help, from writing documentation and reporting bugs, to submitting feature requests or code which can be incorporated into Cloud Seeder itself. Below you'll find guidelines on how to make your contribution as effective as possible.


### Features

If you have ideas for new features or improvements to existing functionality, we would love to hear from you! Please open an issue on our GitHub repository to discuss your ideas. This helps us to gather feedback from other contributors and ensure that your efforts align with the project's goals.

Alternatively, feel free to open a pull request!


### Appliances


- All appliances and the installers for Cloud Seeder must be open source and freely distributable.

- Ensure that any third-party libraries or tools used in the appliances comply with the open source license requirements.

- When contributing a new appliance, please provide documentation on how to use it along with examples.


### Bug Fixes


- **Security Vulnerabilities:** For reporting security issues, please email admin@ipv6.rs. Do not file a public issue. We follow a set process to assess and address security concerns responsibly.

- **General Bugs:** If you encounter other bugs in the project, please open an issue on our GitHub repository with a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, and, if possible, a fix or suggestion on how to resolve it.

### Documentation

Improvements to documentation are as welcome as code changes. If you notice errors or missing information, or if you have suggestions for additional content, please file an issue or open a pull request.

### Testing
